Thank you for downloading WRFPOST.tar as an additional form of postprocessing
data from WRF derivative forecast models.  

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Product Description
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This product was created mainly for the Hurricane Research Devision's (HRD) 
Hurricane Research System (HRS) forecast model output. The files contained
in this tar file have the GRIB 1 library and the codes to install and run
this postprocessor.  

In short, this postprocessor will convert data ouputed by the HRS forecast
model which is in NetCDF format into GRIB 1 format.  The main variables it 
converts are: pressure, u- and v- component wind, temperature, specific 
humidity, sea-land mask, accumulated precipitaion amount, albedo, ground 
roughness, skin temperature, and mean sea level pressure. 

To fit rotated latitude longitude grided data into a regular latitude and
longitude grid an interpolation scheme of nearest neighbors was written up 
by Dr. Eugene Clothiaux from Penn State University.  This now includes an 
interpolation into pressure levels via a bilinear program provided by Dr.
Kevin Yeh from HRD.  Further interpolation schemes will be developed as more
time becomes available.

This tar file should contain:
  /install.csh       --> installation of GRIB 1 Library and NetCDF2GRIB_V1.f 
                         program
  /NetCDF2GRIB_V1.f  --> NetCDF to GRIB 1 data converter code
  /runme.csh         --> Will search for postd01_* files and run them through
                         the converter code
  /w3lib.tar         --> GRIB 1 Library which is provided by National Centers
                         for Environmental Prediction
  /Makefile          --> The Makefile for /w3lib/src files
  /README            --> Instruction manual

* Installing
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install this program you need to know a couple of things:
  * where your NetCDF library is located at 
      -> NOTE: If you don't have this library, get your system administrator
               to install the library for you.  We are using the version 3.6.1
               of the NetCDF library.
  * what is your FORTRAN90 compiler in your system
  * where is your model output data going to

1) Currently this package uses pgf90 compiler.  To compile it using some other 
compiler you would need to change two files (install.csh, Makefile) and replace
pgf90 with your own compiler.

2) You would need to insert your NetCDF library path into the user defined 
variable section of install.csh. For example:

     > set LIBNETCDF = /usr/local/netcdf-3.6.1/lib/libnetcdf.a

3) You should also list the entire path of the netcdf.inc file on line 86 of
Version 2 of the code.  This is usually found in the include directory of the 
NetCDF code. For example:  

     include '<path>/netcdf.inc'

On Version 1 edit line 84.

4) Run the installation program.

     > csh install.csh

Congratulations, you have installed the WRF postprocessor.

NOTE:   If you wish to install version one instead, you have to go into the 
install.csh and change line 60 to V1 from V2 in the program names. You can also
download version one from http://met.psu.edu/~mkh182/mkresearch.html for a 
direct way to install version one.

* How do I run it?
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run this program you need to know:
  * the location of your data 
      -> NOTE: For HRD HRS systems, this code is defined similar to older post
               processors, but you must enter in the STORM NAME, YEAR, MONTH, 
               DAY, and HOUR in order for the data to be gribbed in the correct
               /ATMOS file. If you are not in HRD, you must change this path 
               many times.

This program will create a directory, /GRIBfiles/, where all the gribbed data will go into.

  To run this code:
    if your from HRD and using thier systems:

       > csh runme.csh NAME YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR

    if your not, but still wish to use this system:

       > csh runme.csh
